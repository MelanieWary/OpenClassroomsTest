## Context of the project:
Evaluation of the feasability of automatic product classification for e-Commerce with image recognition and NLP

## Objectives of the project:
1. To determine product categories to be used
2. To gauge performance of unsupervised categorization based on (1) product pictures, (2) product descriptions and (3) combined product pictures and descriptions
3. To show the outcome of such a categorization as a 2D representation
4. To identify potential reasons behind misclassification

_Note: Some - but not all - parts of the notebook have been run again 3 months later to reduce the size of the notebook, which explains the differences observed in the results_
